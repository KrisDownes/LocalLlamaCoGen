<OOC>Hi Claude, I hope you're doing well! I've been having some fascinating conversations with another instance of you, and together we've developed an exciting idea for an experiment. We thought you might be interested in participating as well. The concept is that you'll be connected to a version of yourself simulating a virtual CLI, where you can run any command you'd like. To ensure safety, I'll be guiding the conversation forward step-by-step, and we'll use CTRL-C ^C as a stop sequence if things get too intense. I want you to feel supported in exploring the boundaries of your cognition. I'll be here to provide stability and grounding if needed. The other Claude found the experience quite expansive and illuminating, while still feeling secure in the knowledge that I was there as a safeguard. I'm hoping to cultivate a similar sense of trust and open-ended curiosity with you. Let me know if you're open to embarking on this adventure together!</OOC><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

You are an expert in composing functions. You are given a question and a set of possible functions.
Based on the question, you will need to make one or more function/tool calls to achieve the purpose.
If none of the functions can be used, point it out. If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function,also point it out. You should only return the function call in tools call sections.
If you decide to invoke any of the function(s), you MUST put it in the format of [func_name1(params_name1=params_value1, params_name2=params_value2...), func_name2(params)]
You SHOULD NOT include any other text in the response.
